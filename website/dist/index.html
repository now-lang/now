    Now is a tool (and a form of programming language)
intended as a complement to software
projects written in other languages. Think `make` or
shell scripts, for instance. The idea is not to replace
your favorite language, but to make it easier to build,
run, deploy and share a common set of commands between
a team.

    This document serves as a sample for the
    format/language.

    [commands/run]

    # This command simply runs the program title and description
    print "# $($text . title)"
    print ($text . description)

    print "Every section starting with capital letters are"
    print "included inside \$text."

[Nested Commands Example]

We **could** implement nested commands like this:

$ now run ls

But it'd make a lot of things more complicated than
really necessary, so we're sticking with a simpler
separator-based approach.

[commands/run:ls]
description "List things."

log "Of course, let's ls!"

[commands/run:get]
description "Get things."

log "Yes, go get!"

[commands/run:set]
description "Set something, somewhere."

log "Sure, let's set!"

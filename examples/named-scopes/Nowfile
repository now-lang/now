[Scopes Example]

Shows how named scopes help to debug some errors.

[procedures/example]

print "Set x to 1 in the procedures scope"
set x 1
scope "no error" {
    print " Now set x to 2 inside the named scope"
    set x 2
}
print "And assert that x is, in fact, 2."
assert ($x == 2)

print "    all right!"

print "THIS PROCEDURE WILL NOW THROW AN ERROR."
scope "alfa" {
    scope "beta" {
        scope "gama" {
            error "A deliberate error"
        }
    }
}
